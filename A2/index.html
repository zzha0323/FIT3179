            <p>The <b>military expenditure</b> (or military budget) usually reflects how strongly a country perceives
              the likelihood of a threat to it or wishes to launch an invasion. The size of the budget also reflects a
              country's ability to fund military activities. Factors include the size of the country's economy, the
              entity's other financial needs, and the willingness of the entity's government or people to finance such
              military activities. </p>
            <p>Military expenditure can be divided into two main categories: <b>military expenditure by regions</b> and
              <b>military expenditure by countries</b>.

          <p>The <b>United States</b> has historically had the most expensive military budget (1960 - 2022). Other

            leading the way in terms of military expenditure. Keep in mind that large increases in military budgets can
            be caused by population growth, economic growth,

            <h2>Military Expenditure by Regions</h2>
            <p>
              <b>Military expenditure by regions</b> refers to the amount of money that countries in specific geographic
              regions or continents allocate for their defense and military-related activities. This information is
              crucial for assessing regional security dynamics and understanding the distribution of defense resources
              globally.
